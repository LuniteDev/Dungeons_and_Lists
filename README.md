# Dungeons and Lists - A Dungeons and Dragons Character Manager

## Introduction

Welcome to Dungeons and Lists! As an apprentice software engineer from Switzerland and a passionate Dungeons and Dragons player, I am thrilled to present this web application. Dungeons and Lists is a personal project that I have created outside of work and school. As a member of the queer community, I wanted to develop a tool that not only helps organize D&D characters but also promotes inclusivity and celebrates diversity among players.

## Getting Started

To make use of Dungeons and Lists, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the "Dungeons and Lists" repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary environment for running web applications, such as Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
3. Install all required dependencies using your preferred package manager.
4. Set up a MongoDB database to securely store character information.
5. Launch the application and access it through your web browser.

## Features

- **Authentication:** For added security, Dungeons and Lists requires users to log in before accessing their characters. Rest assured that only you will have access to your characters and their information.

- **Character Categorization:** Characters can be organized into three main categories:
    - **Active Characters:** Characters that are currently being played in an ongoing campaign.
    - **Retired or Inactive Characters:** Characters who have completed their campaigns, met an untimely fate, or were retired from play.
    - **Ready-to-Play Characters:** Characters that are fully prepared but not currently in use.

- **Class-Based Organization:** Within each main category, characters are further sorted based on their class. This allows for quick and easy identification of characters with similar abilities and attributes.

- **Character Information:** When adding a new character, provide essential details such as their name, race, class, main category, and character statistics (stats).

- **Character Images and PDFs:** Give life to your characters by uploading images or attaching character sheets in PDF format. This adds a visual dimension to your creations.

- **Database Storage:** All character information, including categorization and images, is securely stored in a database, ensuring your data is safe and readily accessible.

## Usage

1. **Login:** Access Dungeons and Lists and log in using your credentials to gain access to your personalized characters.

2. **Add a Character:** Navigate to the "Add Character" section and fill in the necessary details, such as name, race, class, and main category. You can also upload character images or attach their character sheets as PDFs for reference.

3. **Categorize Your Character:** Choose the main category for your character based on their current status. The system will automatically sort them into the appropriate category and subcategory based on their class.

4. **View and Edit Characters:** The dashboard displays all your characters. Click on a character to view its details, and feel free to edit or update the information as needed.

5. **Search and Sort:** Use the search functionality or sorting options to find characters based on various parameters, such as name, race, class, or main category.
